A small clinic uses a simple computer system to manage its daily work. The system stores information about patients, doctors, and appointments. For patients, it records details such as name, age, gender, and contact number. For doctors, it stores their name and medical specialization, such as ophthalmology. Clinic staff use the system to view patient details and identify senior patients who are older than 65 years so they can be given priority care. The system also helps staff manage doctor records and check how many doctors specialize in a particular field, like ophthalmology.By using this system, the clinic keeps its records organized, reduces manual work, and provides better care to patients.
